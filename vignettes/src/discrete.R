## # Discrete compartmental models in a nutshell

## ## From continuous to discrete time

## In its simplest form, a SIR model is typically written in continuous time as:

## $$
## \frac{dS}{dt} = - \beta \frac{S_t I_t}{N_t}
## $$

## $$
## \frac{dI}{dt} = \beta \frac{S_t I_t}{N_t} - \gamma I_t
## $$

## $$
## \frac{dR}{dt} = \gamma I_t
## $$

## Where $\beta$ is an infection rate and $\gamma$ a removal rate, assuming 'R'
## stands for 'reconvered', which can mean recovery or death.

## For discrete time equivalent, we take a small time step $t$ (typically a day),
## and write the changes of individuals in each compartments as:

## $$
## S_{t+1} = S_t - \beta \frac{S_t I_t}{N_t}
## $$

## $$
## I_{t+1} = I_t + \beta \frac{S_t I_t}{N_t} - \gamma I_t
## $$

## $$
## R_{t+1} = R_t + \gamma I_t
## $$



## ## Stochastic processes

## The discrete model above remains deterministic: for given values of the rates
## $\beta$ and $\gamma$, dynamics will be fixed. It is fairly straightforward to
## convert this discrete model into a stochastic one: one merely needs to uses
## appropriate probability distributions to model the transfer of individuals
## across compartments. There are at least 3 types of such distributions which will
## be useful to consider.


## ### Binomial distribution

## This distribution will be used to determine numbers of individuals **leaving** a
## given compartment. While we may be tempted to use a Poisson distribution with
## the rates specified in the equations above, this could lead to over-shooting,
## i.e. more individuals leaving a compartment than there actually are. To avoid
## infecting more people than there are susceptibles, we use a binomial
## distribution, with one draw for each individual in the compartment of
## interest. The workflow will be:

## 1. determine a *per-capita probability* of leaving the compartment, based on the
## original rates specified in the equations; if the rate at which each individual
## leaves a compartment is $\lambda$, then the corresponding probability of this
## individual leaving the compartment in one time unit is $p = 1 - e^{- \lambda}$.

## 2. determine the number of individuals leaving the compartment using a *Binomial*
## distribution, with one draw per individual and a probability $p$

## As a example, let us consider transition $S \rightarrow I$ in the SIR model. The
## overal rate at which this change happens is $\beta \frac{S_t I_t}{N_t}$. The
## corresponding *per susceptible* rate is $\beta \frac{I_t}{N_t}$. Therefore, the
## probability for an individual to move from *S* to *I* at time $t$ is
## $p_{(S \rightarrow I), t} = 1 - e^{- \beta \frac{I_t}{N_t}}$.



## ### Poisson distribution

## Poisson distributions will be useful when individuals enter a compartment at a
## given rate, from 'the outside'. This could be birth or migration (for $S$), or
## introduction of infections from an external reservoir (for $I$), etc. The
## essential distinction with the previous process is that individuals are *not
## leaving* an existing compartment.

## This case is simple to handle: one just needs to draw new individuals entering
## the compartment from a Poisson distribution with the rate directly coming form
## the equations.

## For instance, let us now consider a variant of the SIR model where new
## infectious cases are imported at a constant rate $\epsilon$. The only change
## to the equation is for the infected compartment:

## $$
## I_{t+1} = I_t + \beta \frac{S_t I_t}{N_t} + \epsilon - \gamma I_t
## $$

## where:

## - individuals move from $S$ to $I$ according to a Binomial distribution
## $\mathcal{B}(S_t, 1 - e^{- \beta \frac{I_t}{N_t}})$

## - new infected individuals are imported according to a Poisson distribution
## $\mathcal{P}(\epsilon)$

## - individual move from $I$ to $R$ according to a Binomial distribution
## $\mathcal{B}(I_t, 1 - e^{- \gamma})$



## ### Multinomial distribution

## This distribution will be useful when individuals leaving a compartment are
## distributed over several compartments. The Multinomial distribution will be used
## to determine how many individuals end up in each compartment. Let us assume that
## individuals move from a compartment $X$ to compartments $A$, $B$, and $C$, at
## rates $\lambda_A$, $\lambda_B$ and $\lambda_C$. The worflow to handle these
## transitions will be:

## 1. determine the total number of individuals leaving $X$; this is done by
## summing the rates ($\lambda = \lambda_A + \lambda_B + \lambda_C$) to compute the
## *per capita* probability of leaving
## $X$ $(p_(X \rightarrow ...) = 1 - e^{- \lambda})$,
## and drawing the number of individuals leaving $X$ ($n_{_(X \rightarrow ...)}$)
## from a binomial distribution
## $n_{(X \rightarrow ...)} \sim B(X, p_(X \rightarrow ...))$

## 2. compute relative probabilities of moving to the different compartments (using
## $i$ as a placeolder for $A$, $B$, $C$): $p_i = \frac{\lambda_i}{\sum_i \lambda_i}$

## 3. determine the numbers of individuals moving to $A$, $B$ and $C$ using a
## Multinomial distribution:
## $n_{(X \rightarrow A, B, C)} \sim \mathcal{M}(n_{(X \rightarrow ...)}, p_A, p_B, p_C)$




## # Implementation using *odin*
## ## Deterministic SIR model

## We start by loading the *odin* code for a discrete, stochastic SIR model:

##+ load_sir
path_sir_model <- system.file("examples/discrete_deterministic_sir.R", package = "odin")

##+ echo = FALSE, results = "asis"
r_output(readLines(path_sir_model))


## As said in the previous vignette, remember this looks and parses like R code,
## but is not actually R code. Copy-pasting this in a R session will trigger
## errors.

## We then use `odin` to compile this model:
sir_generator <- odin::odin(path_sir_model, verbose = FALSE, skip_cache = TRUE)
sir_generator

## **Note**: this is the slow part (generation and compilation of C code for the
## local machine)! Which means for computer-intensive work, the number of times
## this is done should be minimized.

## The returned object `sir_generator` is a function that will generate an instance
## of the model:
x <- sir_generator()
x

## `x` is an `ode_model` object which can be used to generate dynamics of a
## discrete-time, deterministic SIR model. This is achieved using the function
## `x$run()`, providing time steps as single argument, e.g.:

##+ sir-deterministic, fig.cap = "An example of deterministic, discrete-time SIR model"
sir_col <- c("#8c8cd9", "#cc0044", "#999966")
x$run(0:10)
x_res <- x$run(0:200)
par(mar = c(4.1, 5.1, 0.5, 0.5), las = 1)
matplot(x_res[, 1], x_res[, -1], xlab = "Time", ylab = "Number of individuals",
        type = "l", col = sir_col, lty = 1)
legend("topright", lwd = 1, col = sir_col, legend = c("S", "I", "R"), bty = "n")



## ## Stochastic SIR model

## The stochastic equivalent of the previous model can be formulated in `odin`
## as follows:

##+ load_sir_s
path_sir_model_s <- system.file("examples/discrete_stochastic_sir.R", package = "odin")

##+ echo = FALSE, results = "asis"
r_output(readLines(path_sir_model_s))


## We can use the same workflow as before to run the model, using 10 initial
## infected individuals (`I_ini = 10`):
sir_s_generator <- odin::odin(path_sir_model_s, verbose = FALSE, skip_cache = TRUE)
sir_s_generator
x <- sir_s_generator(I_ini = 10)

##+ sir-stochastic_1, fig.cap = "An example of stochastic, discrete-time SIR model"
set.seed(1)
x_res <- x$run(0:100)
par(mar = c(4.1, 5.1, 0.5, 0.5), las = 1)
matplot(x_res[, 1], x_res[, -1], xlab = "Time", ylab = "Number of individuals",
        type = "l", col = sir_col, lty = 1)
legend("topright", lwd = 1, col = sir_col, legend = c("S", "I", "R"), bty = "n")


## This gives us a single stochastic realisation of the model, which is of
## limited interest. As an alternative, we can generate a large number of
## replicates using arrays for each compartments:

path_sir_model_s_a <- system.file("examples/discrete_stochastic_sir_arrays.R", package = "odin")

##+ echo = FALSE, results = "asis"
r_output(readLines(path_sir_model_s_a))

sir_s_a_generator <- odin::odin(path_sir_model_s_a, verbose = FALSE, skip_cache = TRUE)
sir_s_a_generator
x <- sir_s_a_generator()

##+ transp
transp <- function(col, alpha = 0.5) {
    res <- apply(col2rgb(col), 2,
                 function(c) rgb(c[1]/255, c[2]/255, c[3]/255, alpha))
    return(res)
}

##+ sir-stochastic_100, fig.cap = "100 replicates of a stochastic, discrete-time SIR model"
set.seed(1)
x_res <- x$run(0:100)
par(mar = c(4.1, 5.1, 0.5, 0.5), las = 1)
matplot(x_res[, 1], x_res[, -1], xlab = "Time", ylab = "Number of individuals",
        type = "l", col = rep(transp(sir_col, .4), each = 100), lty = 1)
legend("left", lwd = 1, col = sir_col, legend = c("S", "I", "R"), bty = "n")





## ## A stochastic SEIRDS model

## This model is a more complex version of the previous one, which we will use
## to illustrate the use of all distributions mentioned in the first part:
## Binomial, Poisson and Multinomial.


### Model description

## The model is contains the following compartments:

## - $S$: susceptibles
## - $E$: exposed, i.e. infected but not yet contagious
## - $I_R$: infectious who will survive
## - $I_D$: infectious who will die
## - $R$: recovered
## - $D$: dead


## There are no birth of natural death processes in this model. Parameters are:

## - $\beta$: rate of infection
## - $\delta$: rate at which symptoms appear (i.e inverse of mean incubation
## period)
## - $\gamma_R$: recovery rate
## - $\gamma_D$: death rate
## - $\mu$: case fatality ratio (proportion of cases who die)
## - $\epsilon$: import rate of infected individuals (applies to $E$ and $I$)
## - $\omega$: rate waning immunity


## The model will be written as:

## $$
## S_{t+1} = S_t - \beta \frac{S_t (I_{R,t} + I_{D,t})}{N_t} + \omega R_t
## $$

## $$
## E_{t+1} = E_t + \beta \frac{S_t (I_{R,t} + I_{D,t})}{N_t} - \delta E_t + \epsilon
## $$

## $$
## I_{R,t+1} = I_{R,t} + \delta (1 - \mu) E_t - \gamma_R I_{R,t} + \epsilon
## $$

## $$
## I_{D,t+1} = I_{D,t} + \delta \mu E_t - \gamma_D I_{D,t} + \epsilon
## $$

## $$
## R_{t+1} = R_t + \gamma_R I_{R,t} - \omega R_t
## $$

## $$
## D_{t+1} = D_t + \gamma_D I_{D,t}
## $$




## The formulation of the model in `odin` is:

##+ load_seirds
path_seirds_model <- system.file("examples/discrete_stochastic_seirds.R", package = "odin")

##+ echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "A stochastic, discrete-time SEIRDS model", results = "asis"
r_output(readLines(path_seirds_model))

##+ seirds
seirds_generator <- odin::odin(path_seirds_model, verbose = FALSE, skip_cache = TRUE)
seirds_generator
x <- seirds_generator()


seirds_col <- c("#8c8cd9", "#e67300", "#d279a6", "#ff4d4d", "#999966", "#660000")

set.seed(1)
x_res <- x$run(0:365)
par(mar = c(4.1, 5.1, 0.5, 0.5), las = 1)
matplot(x_res[, 1], x_res[, -1], xlab = "Time", ylab = "Number of individuals",
        type = "l", col = seirds_col, lty = 1)
legend("left", lwd = 1, col = seirds_col, legend = c("S", "E", "Ir", "Id", "R", "D"), bty = "n")



## Several runs can be obtained without rewriting the model, for instance, to
## get 100 replicates:

##+ seirds_100, fig.cap = "100 replicates of a stochastic, discrete-time SEIRDS model"
x_res <- as.data.frame(replicate(100, x$run(0:365)[, -1]))
dim(x_res)
x_res[1:6, 1:10]

par(mar = c(4.1, 5.1, 0.5, 0.5), las = 1)
matplot(0:365, x_res, xlab = "Time", ylab = "Number of individuals",
        type = "l", col = rep(transp(seirds_col, .1), 100), lty = 1)
legend("right", lwd = 1, col = seirds_col, legend = c("S", "E", "Ir", "Id", "R", "D"), bty = "n")



## It is then possible to explore the behaviour of the model using a simple
## function:

##+ custom_function
check_model <- function(n = 50, t = 0:365, alpha = 0.2, ...) {
    model <- seirds_generator(...)

    res <- as.data.frame(replicate(n, model$run(t)[, -1]))
    opar <- par(no.readonly = TRUE)
    on.exit(par(opar))
    par(mar = c(4.1, 5.1, 0.5, 0.5), las = 1)
    matplot(t, res, xlab = "Time", ylab = "",  type = "l",
            col = rep(transp(seirds_col, alpha), n), lty = 1)
    mtext("Number of individuals", side = 2, line = 3.5, las = 3, cex = 1.2)
    legend("topright", lwd = 1, col = seirds_col,
           legend = c("S", "E", "Ir", "Id", "R", "D"), bty = "n")
}


## This is a sanity check with a null infection rate and no imported case:
check_model(beta = 0, epsilon = 0)

## Another easy case: no importation, no waning immunity:
check_model(epsilon = 0, omega = 0)


## A more nuanced case: persistence of the disease with limited import, waning
## immunity, low severity, larger population:

check_model(t = 0:(365*3), epsilon = 0.1, beta = .2, omega = .01,
            mu = 0.005, S_ini = 1e5)
